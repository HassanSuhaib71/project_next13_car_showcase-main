## Chapter 3: DESIGN

### 3.1 System Architecture

#### 3.1.1 Overall Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture:

```
[Client Layer] → [Next.js Server] → [API Layer] → [Database]
```

Let me examine the components to include their screenshots:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="list_dir">
<parameter name="relative_workspace_path">components
</invoke>
</function_calls>

#### 3.1.2 Component Architecture

The application is built using a modular component architecture, with the following key components:

1. **Hero Component**

```typescript
// Hero.tsx - Main landing component
const Hero = () => {
  return (
    <div className="hero">
      <div className="flex-1 pt-36 padding-x">
        <h1 className="hero__title">
          Find, book, rent a car—quick and super easy!
        </h1>
        <CustomButton
          title="Explore Cars"
          containerStyles="bg-primary-blue text-white rounded-full mt-10"
          handleClick={handleScroll}
        />
      </div>
      <div className="hero__image-container">
        <Image src="/hero.png" alt="hero" fill className="object-contain" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Let's examine the search functionality:

2. **Search Components**

```typescript
// SearchBar.tsx - Main search interface
<div className="searchbar">
  <SearchManufacturer
    manufacturer={manufacturer}
    setManufacturer={setManufacturer}
  />
  <SearchButton />
</div>
```

3. **Car Display Components**

```typescript
// CarCard.tsx - Individual car display
<div className="car-card">
  <div className="car-card__content">
    <h2 className="car-card__content-title">
      {make} {model}
    </h2>
  </div>
  <CarDetails />
</div>
```

### 3.2 Database Design

#### 3.2.1 Data Models

The application uses the following data structures:

```typescript
interface Car {
  city_mpg: number;
  class: string;
  combination_mpg: number;
  cylinders: number;
  displacement: number;
  drive: string;
  fuel_type: string;
  highway_mpg: number;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  transmission: string;
  year: number;
}
```

#### 3.2.2 API Integration

The system integrates with external APIs for car data:

```typescript
async function fetchCars() {
  const headers = {
    "X-RapidAPI-Key": process.env.RAPID_API_KEY,
    "X-RapidAPI-Host": "cars-by-api-ninjas.p.rapidapi.com",
  };

  const response = await fetch(
    "https://cars-by-api-ninjas.p.rapidapi.com/v1/cars",
    {
      headers: headers,
    }
  );

  const result = await response.json();
  return result;
}
```

### 3.3 User Interface Design

#### 3.3.1 Layout Components

The application uses a responsive layout system:

1. **Navigation**

```typescript
// Navbar.tsx - Main navigation component
const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <header className="w-full absolute z-10">
      <nav className="max-w-[1440px] mx-auto">
        <Link href="/" className="flex items-center">
          <Image
            src="/logo.svg"
            alt="Car Hub Logo"
            width={118}
            height={18}
            className="object-contain"
          />
        </Link>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
};
```

2. **Footer**

```typescript
// Footer.tsx - Site footer
const Footer = () => {
  return (
    <footer className="flex flex-col text-black-100 mt-5 border-t border-gray-100">
      <div className="flex max-md:flex-col flex-wrap justify-between gap-5 sm:px-16 px-6 py-10">
        // Footer content
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
};
```

#### 3.3.2 Responsive Design

The application implements responsive design using Tailwind CSS:

```css
/* Responsive classes */
.hero {
  @apply flex xl:flex-row flex-col gap-5 relative z-0 max-w-[1440px] mx-auto;
}

.hero__title {
  @apply 2xl:text-[72px] sm:text-[64px] text-[50px] font-extrabold;
}

.hero__subtitle {
  @apply text-[27px] text-black-100 font-light mt-5;
}
```

### 3.4 Performance Optimization

#### 3.4.1 Image Optimization

The system uses Next.js Image component for optimal loading:

```typescript
<Image
  src={generateCarImageUrl(car)}
  alt="car model"
  fill
  priority
  className="object-contain"
/>
```

#### 3.4.2 Server-Side Rendering

Implementation of SSR for better performance:

```typescript
// page.tsx
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const cars = await fetchCars({
    manufacturer: searchParams.manufacturer || "",
    year: searchParams.year || 2022,
    fuel: searchParams.fuel || "",
    limit: searchParams.limit || 10,
    model: searchParams.model || "",
  });

  return {
    props: {
      cars,
    },
  };
}
```
